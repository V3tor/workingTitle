	-differentiate between TV and movies (based on directories ??)
	-queries - variable searching through video media files using Db
	-indexing videos in the Db.
		-upon launch check existence of each media file in the Db.  If non-exixtent, add title into a place-holder table along with date.  Program will then search for the details online and fill in the Db.
